## Overview Section

Polyneo's long glass fiber thermoplastic compounds are engineered for applications that demand **high strength, stiffness, and impact resistance**, often replacing metal or short-fiber plastics.

By preserving fiber length through formulation and processing optimization, our LGF compounds deliver superior structural performance while enabling **light-weighting and part consolidation**.

Our LGF solutions allow designers to achieve metal-like performance with the processing advantages and weight savings of thermoplastics.
